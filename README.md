# h2_model
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

*WIP* 

Run the model with `python main.py`.
`trackeback_path.py` and `traceforward_path.py` can be sued for post processing.

## Notes

- `data/generate_inputs_json.py` converts the contents of `data/inputs/` into a JSON file that is read by the model.
- price multipliers in hubs.csv are randomly generated and currently not valid
